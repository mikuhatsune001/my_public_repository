This is a beta version, that means that some things need testing or
fine-tuning. This file includes the things I would like to be informed
about. So if you are able to test one of these things, please do so and mail
me back the results. (coder@reptile.rug.ac.be)

  - Does sniffing a PPP connection work?
    
    If sniffit just sits there, doing nothing, try changing (sn_data.h)
    
    #ifdef IRIX
    #define NETDEV_NR      2
    char *NETDEV[]={"ppp","et"};
    int HEADSIZE[]={0    ,14};              /* ppp: 4 or 0 or nothing */
    #endif             

    to:   

    #ifdef IRIX
    #define NETDEV_NR      2
    char *NETDEV[]={"ppp","et"};
    int HEADSIZE[]={4    ,14};              /* ppp: 4 or 0 or nothing */
    #endif               


4. FreeBSD

  - Does sniffing a PPP connection work?
    To try this, remove the lines that are marked below with X in the
    sn_data.h file:  

    #ifdef FREEBSD                          /* ppp: 4 or 0 ? */      
    /*									X
    #define NETDEV_NR      2                                         
    char *NETDEV[]={"ppp","ed"};            
    int HEADSIZE[]={4    ,14};                                       
    */									X
    #define NETDEV_NR      1						X
    char *NETDEV[]={"ed"};          					X
    int HEADSIZE[]={14}; 						X
    #endif                             

    If it doesn't work, and sniffit just sits there, try changing:
    
    int HEADSIZE[]={4    ,14};

    to:

    int HEADSIZE[]={0    ,14};


5. BSDi

  - Does sniffing a PPP connection work?
    To try this, remove the lines that are marked below with X in the
    sn_data.h file:

    #ifdef BSDI                             /* ppp: 4 or 0 ? */
    /*									X
    #define NETDEV_NR      2                                         
    char *NETDEV[]={"ppp","ef"};                                     
    int HEADSIZE[]={4    ,14};                                       
    */									X
    #define NETDEV_NR      1						X
    char *NETDEV[]={"ef"};  						X
    int HEADSIZE[]={14}; 						X
    #endif                               

    If it doesn't work, and sniffit just sits there, try changing:

    int HEADSIZE[]={4    ,14};

    to:   

    int HEADSIZE[]={0    ,14};

7. NetBSD 

 - Does sniffing a PPP connection work?

   If sniffit just sits there, doing nothing, try changing the sn_data.h
   file. Search the line:
   
   #ifdef NETBSD   

   from there on change in every "int HEADSIZE[]={}" the 4 to a 0.

   e.g.: int HEADSIZE[]={4    ,14  ,14};
         becomes: int HEADSIZE[]={0    ,14  ,14};
